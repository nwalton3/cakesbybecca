			<img src="img/2016-11-luke.jpg" alt="Image of Humpty Dumpty cake" />
			<figcaption>This is the cake that I made for one of my teachers daughters birthday. It was a really small 6 in cake, but it took me over 6 hours to do at least. The actual humpty dumpty was made of rice crispie treats, and covered in fondant. The arms and legs are something called gum paste. Gum paste hardens really hard, and so you can make things like arms and legs out&nbsp;of&nbsp;it.</figcaption>
